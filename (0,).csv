@Michellefrenlish,"It's been about a month and 20 days
And we're going round and round just playing silly games
Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now
Then ya wink at me and walk away
Let it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time, I need to feel you
we're all alone
(Ride it) just lose control
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you

(Ride it) from head to toe

Movida was the club on the Saturday
Ya actin' like a diva sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya fiesty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a Mojito at the bar
You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite song, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes girl
Whispering, tellin' me, ""We gotta go""
Won't you take me home, I want to
we're all alone

Everything was right until her phone began to ring
She takes it to the corner, that's when I start wondering
I can hear her shouting, banging fists against the door
Yelling ""Yo, it's over, I can't take it any more""
Then I walk away and act all nonchalant and chill
I ain't tryna get all caught up in her mess for real
But she came on out and backed me up against the wall
She said, ""I know you heard but I'll make you forget it all""
Baby, let me feel you
